* Lecturer: Assoc. Prof. Ph.D Cao Thi Nhan + Vu Minh Sang

    This project aims to develop a model to accurately predict the risk of urinary tract disease 
road. Relevant data such as age, gender, cholesterol, BMI, smoking, medical history 
heart rate, physical activity, blood pressure and diet will be collected and cleaned. Too 
This process will include handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization, simultaneously 
Perform exploratory analysis to better understand the characteristics. 

   Advanced machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, 
XGBoost will be applied. Results from this model will help improve early diagnosis, 
Prevent and treat diabetes more effectively. These models will be 
build, then compare performance on criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity and consistency 
signal. The best model will be selected based on the comparison results.
